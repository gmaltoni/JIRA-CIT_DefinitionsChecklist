- Implement definitions for Issue Types by Issue Status. Ex: specific definitions for Legacy Bugs when Done Development.
- Check if current Issue Status already contains a Definition comment:
	- Yes: check if all items were filled in.
		- Yes: not show the form.
		- No: show the form only with the available options to be checked.
	- No: not show the form.
- When creating a comment, check if user can edit an existing Definition comment before creating a new one.
